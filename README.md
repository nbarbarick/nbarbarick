### ðŸ‘‹ Hello.

I'm a creative and analytical writer and editor helping to build the bridge between people and technology.

My professional background in technical publications and as an educator allows me to bring a love of reading, writing, teaching, and learning to complex software documentation projects.

[Check out my resume](https://www.nathanbarbarick.com/assets/nathan-barbarick-resume.pdf) and [email me](mailto:nathanbarbarick@gmail.com) if you'd like to discuss my assistance on your project. I'm most excited by docs-as-code workflows, the full stack, and open source software that helps people do awesome things.
