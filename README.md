### 👋 Hello. I’m Nathan.

I work as a technical writer because I love learning and teaching and reading and writing. 🤓

My goals include developing documentation that helps people to help other people. 🤝 ♻️

I'm interested in writing for projects related to art, education, literature, and/or politics.
